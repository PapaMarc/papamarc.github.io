            <p>Here's a shot of me in my first <a href="tux.jpg">movie</a>...
                OK, would you believe it was at a wedding <a href="whosthat.jpg">I</a>
                went to with a bunch of my longtime <a href="Friends.jpg">friends</a>.
                Heck they even convinced me to get my first <a href="haircutf.jpg">haircut</a> in 4 years
                (back in '9x?). Here's a <a href="haircutn.jpg">closeup</a> of <a
                    href="https://www.bryanbantry.com/about-zaiya">Zaiya</a> going to

                longer, which along w/all the watersports led to a more drastic

                    blowing bubbles</a> and getting bitten by the Cat Shark, while cleaning the
                tank, feeding the fish, and waving to the kids.&nbsp; For a while i kept an <a
                    href="Dive/divelog.htm">online dive log</a> of
                these dives and others, along with some <a href="Dive/SeaAqDiveChart.htm">data

            <p>I spent several years building <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/MIServer">technology
                    which will allow you to get access to key data on your mobile phone</a> even if
                you were away from your desk, and perhaps out on the deck of your boat, etc.&nbsp; This
                involved acquiring and taking many trips to our Stockholm office, where I was inducted into the
                ways of some <a href="images/SwedishCrabfishParty.jpg">odd Swedish traditions</a>

                for their Swedish team member.&nbsp; This technology after shipping two
                versions, was eventually folded back into the Exchange business... in any case,
                now without a doubt you can autodial on your phone, via contacts you maintain on
                your PC w/Outlook...</p>
            <p>Prior to that I worked on several versions of Exchange starting with the V1
                product we shipped, including vision for the first web client long before
                hotmail/gmail/yahoo mail, etc (via <a href="https://slipstick.com/AppFarm.htm">
                    ExWebZapper</a> scheduled html publisher) and ship of the first version of the
                first dynamic web client Exchange Web Access which was rearchitected many a time (<a

                    entry on Jim/Bob</a> et al's work on that) as web tech evolved, and of course rebranded as
                OWA (Outlook Web Access) when the web came along in prominence and when it was obvious internally that
                Exchange was the Server and
                Outlook was the client (until of course Hotmail rebranded to Outlook.com... ha! ...but anyway,
                eventually the Hotmail backend did
                move over to Exchange Server too when its scalability drove further beyond corporate to internet
                megaservice grade). Various ISV
                telephony and mobile integrations, etc... 100million+ seats later the business
                is booming, and is the 3rd most commercially successful in computer software
                history, behind MS Windows and MS Office.</p>
