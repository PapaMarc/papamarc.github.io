        out in Seattle; i got to know him while working on the 1st version of Microsoft Exchange Server
        for several years prior to our shipping the first version.

        Warren's first love was always cars, and in between and in the midst of any tech job he held
        he always also had several project cars going. When i took this truck off his hands i think
        he had 5 projects in the works and only 3 bays (2 at his house and 1 at his mom's).

    <p>Initially on my watch the only visible flaw was the <a HREF="53PUbed.jpg">oak bed</a> which had bowed slightly
        from exposure to the great Northwest liquid sunshine (not that you could tell from the
        picture). I soon worked with a friend (and MSFT colleague) <a

            Gering</a> who had a cabinet shop in his backyard, to
        acquire a felled <a href="https://www.trailerdecking.com/products.aspx?FilterstoAdd=524">Apitong</a> tree which
        we ripped into custom boards and then planed and installed to replace the oak. That said,
        it's going on 3 decades under my care, and while i've kept her mechanically sound or better i'm sorry to say the
        past decade+ oceanside in FLL haven't been as kind to the body which is no longer without rust.
        For at least the past 5 years, i've been of the mind i'll drive her at least another couple decades and then
        find a kid who's ready to do the next frame off resto.

        More recently (Summer '22), after sitting idle for a several years while we were living over in Beijing—I did an
        overhaul to the fuel, air and ignition system upon our return. While most of it was fairly straightforward
        including replacing the <a href="https://amzn.to/3LKGd59" target="_blank">Carter P4070</a> inline electric
        fuel pump, and all the fuel lines (and oil lines between engine and filter), air filters, and new points and
        condenser in the old Delco-Remy model#1112353 distributor along with new plugs (Champion J6C) and silicone
        cables/boots, coil
        and ballast resistor. <br>

        The pièce de résistance in that summer overhaul was in sending the carbs out to Thomas Bryant in Wiscasset,
        Maine for a proper rebuild. I then followed his <a
            href="https://thosbryant.wordpress.com/2015/10/04/su-carburetor-tuning/">SU carb tuning guide</a> to adjust
        and <a href="53synchronize.jpg">synchronize</a> them.
        To complete that assignment, I also acquired a vintage Actron Model612 tach off ebay, after unsuccessfully
        attempting to try to measure rpm on a digital meter
        via what should have been simple math: <br>
        eg. 1500rpm = 60sec x 2 (revs /spark for 4 stroke… or 1 if it’s derived via crankshaft rev per spark) x 12.5Hz.
        However, I quickly gave up on that after proving empirically
        that attempting to read anything on the digital readout was maddening & futile—the numbers updated continuously
        with such variation and frequency that essentially
        all LED entries remained illuminated; useless. So I bought the old tach off ebay which worked beautifully. <br>
        Tom is a wealth of knowledge and couldn't have been more helpful throughout, other than if he had perhaps flown
        down here and adjusted them with me under my FL shade tree-- can’t thank him enough for his insights and
        expertise along with his willingness to share them. I had always called the carbs Volvo SUs but as I learned
        from him…
        Carb#1 (by the radiator) is MGA, and Carbs #2 and #3 (by the firewall) are Volvo B16Bs, both of which are <a
            href="https://mossmotors.com/mga-012-carburetors">TypeH4 twin-cam models</a> (albeit the Moss diagram is
        apparently mislabelled H6).
        Further, in order to fit-- 2 float bowls from those original units are swapped given how #3 has to fit up
        against the firewall… so #3 (a B16B carb) actually has the MGA float bowl, and #1 (a MGA carb) now has the Volvo
        float bowl. And to top them off (pun intended), as i initially sent them to Tom they were utilized internally
        vented dampers and #1 had a plastic top (whereas #2 & #3 had superior brass tops), despite the carbs being
        spec'ed as calling for unvented dampers. He said that should be just fine to go w/the vented dampers, though
        upon return he had refitted MGA#1 carb with a brass topped unvented damper. <br>
        Gotta love such an idiosyncratic setup ;-)
        <br> <br>

        Summer '23 i <a href="53starterrebuild.jpg">pulled the starter</a> and while spending time in Fort Lauderdale,
        had the old man behind <a href="https://www.reliabiltparts.com/">Hollywood Starter & Alternator</a> rebuild do
        just that. And at my <a href="nerdbench.jpg">nerd bench</a>, i <a href="53fuelsender.jpg">rewired the fuel
            sender</a> which no longer had insulation and was shorting out, so i once again have no need to track
        mileage between fill-ups and manually calculate mileage to know i have fuel in the tank! I did also purchase a
        <a href="https://amzn.to/4cavk7j" target="_blank">Pertronix 1168LS</a> electronic ignition unit which at
        some point in the not too distant future I’ll swap into the original Delco-Remy distributor in place of the
        points and condenser, and retune again. <br>
        To round it all out, since I’ve been using it as a daily driver of late… it’s all now rolling on a new set of
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3YokEyz" target="_blank">BFGoodrich 235 60/R15 Radial T/A</a> tires.
