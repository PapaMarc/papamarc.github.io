    <h2>Marc's Products:</h2>
    <br>
    Almost to a fault, i fix everything and keep it working after most others would replace it. So, in general i don't
    think of myself as a big consumer. However, there are a few products i really like, many of which help me keep me
    and my
    stuff ticking...
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Alexa Home Automation related:</h2><br>I've found the following items useful and fun in automating my
            home
            via seamless integration into the Amazon Alexa ecosystem.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Several <a href="https://amzn.to/4fuHlHu" target="_blank">Kasa Smart Plugs</a> which allow you to say
                "Alexa, turn on the
                <a href="https://amzn.to/3ybZadR" target="_blank">TubeAmp</a>" (which the <a
                    href="https://amzn.to/4fuHFWI" target="_blank">Amazon Echo Dot</a> has a BT
                connection to, enabling great HiFi stereo via which you can play
                PrimeMusic-- included w/your AmazonPrime subscription, Pandora, Spotify, etc in your home), and "Alexa,
                turn on the <a href="https://amzn.to/46sVVeq" target="_blank">Mr. Coffee</a> at 6:15a" after you've
                setup the coffee pot the evening before.
            </li>
            <li>Several <a href="https://amzn.to/3WW02Nj" target="_blank">Kasa Smart Light Switches</a> which allow you
                to say
                "Alexa, turn on the DenLight", to set the porch light to go on at Sunset & off at Sunrise, via a timer
                rule, and allowing "Alexa, after 15min turn off the BathroomFan" when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/4dqbG8a" target="_blank">TREATLIFE Smart Ceiling Fan Control and light
                    dimmer</a> which allow you

            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/3WLCfiQ" target="_blank">Sengled Smart LED multicolor bulb</a> which allow
                you to say "Alexa, turn on the MagicLight" or "Alexa, MagicLight 20%" or "Alexa, MagicLight red"</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/3YuiBcm" target="_blank">Refoss Smart WiFi Garage Door Opener</a> which allow
                you to say "Alexa, close the garage door" or to open/close it from your phone.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/4ccKDMG" target="_blank">Fire TV Stick 4k</a> so you can cut the cord and
                have voice command over your existing set... or if you're due for a new TV, perhaps the <a
                    href="https://amzn.to/4flqWVX" target="_blank">65" Omni Series 4K UHD smart TV</a> or the <a
                    href="https://amzn.to/3WwiZo6" target="_blank">55" Omni QLED Series 4K UHD smart TV</a>.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/4cVDxNT" target="_blank">Sharp ZSMC1469HS Microwave Oven</a> which allow
                you to say "Alexa, microwave my frozen peas for 5min." fwiw, not saying you should buy a new microwave
                SO that you can say that, however if you were going to get a new microwave this might fit the bill, and
                the home automation theme. It does keep its time in sync (and resets time after power failures)-- so you
                can really use it as a kitchen clock on school days. I find it actually works quite well, though i do
                get some side eye from other
                family members when speak to the micro... <br>
                I have a Samsung (Model #NE63BG8315SS) stovetop/oven in the kitchen as well, and can similarly
                turn on/off the oven light via Alexa, along w/keeping its clock sync'ed.<br>
                Ahh... the IoT. Yeah... the Internet, it's gonna be big someday.</li>

        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm a single piece <a href="https://amzn.to/4fup3pR" target="_blank">Toto Ultramax Elongated 1 Piece

                entirely
                unnecessary... butt there are far worse ways to flush $5.
            </li>
            <li>In a more traditional tool sense... to the extent you want or need
                to replace an old, multi-turn gate valve to shutoff supply for your toilet (or sink), in favor of a
                working, <a href="https://amzn.to/42paCPQ" target="_blank">modern 1/4 turn ball valve</a> (maintaining
                OG style internal copper compression fitting),
                and in the process of attempting to reuse the old nut and ferrule find it seeping or worse
                due to mineral deposits or other corrosion needing remediation prior to new refitting...
                you will need a US threaded
                (hard to find-- i bought 2 other tools first which had foreign/metric threads, despite claims to the
                contrary, before settling on this one)

                    href="https://amzn.to/3Wxa2fa" target="_blank">these tub and sink strainers</a> make a great

            <li>On the simple side of things, a great cup of coffee (albeit not espresso) can be made

                while
                in
                Stavelot, Belgium in summer '23 upon returning our year-long exchange student, my '3rd daughter'
                Lia, to
                her
                rightful
                family. I had first started drinking coffee at breakfast time decades earlier as an exchange student
                myself in
                Florence, Italy from one of the traditional, aluminum, Italian mokas. The <a

                event,
                i prefer stainless versions, as shared.
                It will undoubtedly break less in the 1st case v. the more common glass version. I've replaced many
                a

                2nd
                case
                of the stainless moka, it will not leach aluminum.

                The back story on the Lever machine is as follows... at some point in the early fall of '24,
                subsequent
                to packing out full Tetris stylie in Seattle, and driving cross country in a 15' U-Haul
                box truck containing many a sundry from 20yrs prior...
                one of the finds locked away for two decades,
                shortly before i was closing up the last panel on the storage lock down in '04 on heading to Hong
                Kong,
                unbeknownst to me was a

                which someone
                had gifted me, noting it needed a rebuild but was right up my alley.
                I can honestly say at the time i had no idea what it was (other than the obvious in terms of my
                knowing it was an espresso machine).
                <br>
                A few weeks after arriving in FL, the machine's shiny exterior
                reflected some light from a corner piled w/other boxes from the trip and called to me leading me to
                plug
                it in on a kitchen
                counter. I attempted to 'pull a shot' (a term I only later heard, and began to appreciate)... and
                got
                nothing but dirty water. It was at that point i recalled the mention of the need rebuild...
                <br>
                Because i have this constant nagging hunch that, the internet is going to be big someday, i set out
                surfing
                the
                interwebs to learn all i could. It wasn't long before i started to get a picture of what might lay
                ahead.
                Suffice it to say, thanks in part to a not well deliberated yet fortuitous last minute decision to
                squeeze it on the truck v. dispatch it as part the final Goodwill run... my morning routine has been
                transformed.
