    <h2>Marc's Products:</h2>
    <br>
    Almost to a fault, i fix everything and keep it working after most others would replace it. I like to know how
    things work, and this often leads to disassembling them, understanding their design, and when/where possible leaving
    them better than i found them. I've often referred to this practice as Quiet Games. This drive was consistent from
    one of my first jobs as a bicycle mechanic in my early
    teens, through a career in software design. While in general i don't
    think of myself as a big consumer, there are a few products i really like, often though not exclusively, tools; many
    of which help me keep me
    and my
    stuff ticking...
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Alexa Home Automation related:</h2><br>I've found the following items useful and fun in automating my
            home
            via seamless integration into the Amazon Alexa ecosystem.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Several <a href="https://amzn.to/4fuHlHu" target="_blank">Kasa Smart Plugs</a> which allow you to say
                "Alexa, turn on the
                <a href="https://amzn.to/3ybZadR" target="_blank">TubeAmp</a>" (which the <a
                    href="https://amzn.to/4fuHFWI" target="_blank">Amazon Echo Dot</a> has a BT
                connection to, enabling great HiFi stereo via which you can play
                PrimeMusic-- included w/your AmazonPrime subscription, Pandora, Spotify, etc in your home), and "Alexa,
                turn on the <a href="https://amzn.to/46sVVeq" target="_blank">Mr. Coffee</a> at 6:15a" after you've
                setup the coffee pot the evening before.
            </li>
            <li>Several <a href="https://amzn.to/3WW02Nj" target="_blank">Kasa Smart Light Switches</a> which allow you
                to say
                "Alexa, turn on the DenLight", to set the porch light to go on at Sunset & off at Sunrise, via a timer
                rule, and allowing "Alexa, after 15min turn off the BathroomFan" when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/4dqbG8a" target="_blank">TREATLIFE Smart Ceiling Fan Control and light
                    dimmer</a> which allow you
                to say "Alexa, turn on the CeilingFan"</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/3WLCfiQ" target="_blank">Sengled Smart LED multicolor bulb</a> which allow
                you to say "Alexa, turn on the MagicLight" or "Alexa, MagicLight 20%" or "Alexa, MagicLight red"</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/3YuiBcm" target="_blank">Refoss Smart WiFi Garage Door Opener</a> which allow
                you to say "Alexa, close the garage door" or to open/close it from your phone.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/4ccKDMG" target="_blank">Fire TV Stick 4k</a> so you can cut the cord and
                have voice command over your existing set... or if you're due for a new TV, perhaps the <a

                    href="https://amzn.to/3WwiZo6" target="_blank">55" Omni QLED Series 4K UHD smart TV</a>.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/4cVDxNT" target="_blank">Sharp ZSMC1469HS Microwave Oven</a> which allow
                you to say "Alexa, microwave my frozen peas for 5min." fwiw, not saying you should buy a new microwave
                SO that you can say that, however if you were going to get a new microwave this might fit the bill, and
                the home automation theme. It does keep its time in sync (and resets time after power failures)-- so you
                can really use it as a kitchen clock on school days. I find it actually works quite well, though i do
                get some side eye from other
                family members when speak to the micro... <br>
                I have a Samsung (Model #NE63BG8315SS) stovetop/oven in the kitchen as well, and can similarly
                turn on/off the oven light via Alexa, along w/keeping its clock sync'ed.<br>

            <li>In a more traditional tool sense... to the extent you want or need
                to replace an old, multi-turn gate valve to shutoff supply for your toilet (or sink), in favor of a

                due to mineral deposits or other corrosion needing remediation prior to new refitting...
                you will need a US threaded

                her
                rightful
                family. I had first started drinking coffee at
                breakfast time just shy of 4 decades earlier as an exchange student
                myself in
                Florence, Italy from a traditional, aluminum, dodecahedral Italian moka, or

                one of the finds locked away for two decades,
                shortly before i was closing up the last panel on the storage lock down in '04 on heading to Hong

                which someone
                had gifted me, noting it needed a rebuild but was right up my alley.
                I can honestly say at the time i had no idea what it was (other than the obvious in terms of my
                knowing it was an espresso machine).
                <br>
                A few weeks after arriving in FL, the machine's shiny exterior
                reflected some light from a corner piled w/other boxes from the trip and called to me leading me to
                plug
                it in on a kitchen
                counter. I attempted to 'pull a shot' (a term I only later heard, and began to appreciate)... and
                got
                nothing but dirty water. It was at that point i recalled the mention of the need to rebuild...
                <br>
                Because i have this constant nagging hunch that, the internet is going to be big someday, i set out
                surfing
                the
                interwebs to learn all i could. It wasn't long before i started to get a picture of what might lay
                ahead.
                Suffice it to say, thanks in part to a not well deliberated yet fortuitous last minute decision to
                squeeze it on the truck v. dispatch it as part the final Goodwill run... my morning routine has been
                transformed.
