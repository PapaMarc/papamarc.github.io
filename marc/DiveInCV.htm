</head>

Here are a few details (above and beyond <a href="https://bit.ly/2I44CBs">the simple Bio</a>) regarding my background,
interests and experience
from a water centric perspective. In general, I've always been drawn to
the sea and sea life, and thus the activities on, around and under the water.</span></p>



<p><strong><span lang="en-US" style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif';color:black">In
            short, I'd like to respond to a help wanted ad
            something along the lines of &quot;Window Washer Wanted.&nbsp; Must love fish,
            waving to the kids, and work well under pressure.&quot;</span></strong></p>


<p>Thanks for your consideration; references provided on
    request. I truly look forward to exploring dive related opportunities
    with you in the upcoming months in your tank... Best regards. -Marc</p>

        <ul>
            <li>I grew up sailing on the Great South Bay on Long
                Island, New York and raced Sunfish out of the Bellport Bay Yacht Club; in
                the early 80s I competed in the North Atlantic Regionals in NJ</li>
            <li>I received a <a href="About/dukediploma.jpg">BA in
                    economics from Duke University in 1989</a>; while attending, I <a href="DukeCrew.htm">rowed for Duke
                    University</a> Lightweight Varsity Crew
                1985-86 and 1986-87 seasons.</li>
            <li>I've been an avid diver with over 315 dives logged
                &lt;as of May 21, 2004-- need to update more current tally.&gt;,
                totaling ~214 hours bottom time (or ~9 days) in both fresh and salt
                waters, and cold and warm locations ranging from my <span class=SpellE>my</span>
                current home in Puget Sound and nearby British Columbia, to the warmer
                waters of Hawaii, Tahiti, Australia, Belize, Grand Cayman and South
                Florida.</li>
            <li>For 8 years, I served as a <a href="About/SeattleAquariumID.jpg">volunteer diver at the Seattle
                    Aquarium</a>
                starting in Feb 1996, yielding ~350 hours of total service in
                their 40k gallon Pacific Coral Reef (PCR) tank washing the windows,
                vacuuming the gravel, feeding the fish, and waving to the kids, before i moved to Hong Kong in April
                2004. My
                supervisor Alan Tomita, and chief biologist for the aquarium's Exotics
                team Bill Robertson can be contacted as references regarding my
                work at the Seattle Aquarium and comfort in the water.</li>
            <li>I co-founded and endowed the <a href="../VBS/Default.htm">Victor B. Scheffer foundation</a> in 2000
                which
                has a mission to <a href="http://www.sanjuanislander.com/port/fh/aquarium.shtml">increase the
                    awareness of life in the sea</a>-- it's beauty and diversity, its
                fundamental support of human life, and its sensitivity to human abuse,
                through research and education.</li>
            <li>In '05 I completed my weekly rotation as a <a href="About/OceanParkIDx2.jpg">volunteer</a> in <a
                    href="http://www.oceanpark.com.hk">Hong Kong's Ocean Park</a> <a

                eagle rays, cownose rays, guitarfish, sturgeon, etc) and stellar crew i had
                the good fortune of working with (including David Lai curator OPHK who
                made my participation possible, volunteer coordinator Yvonne Lim, Walter
                Tang now the assistant curator &amp; dive buddy Lell Luk among others
                could upon request provide comment on my time with them).</li>
            <li>On moving to South Florida in '08 i
                became an active member of <a href="http://www.kayuba.org/KayubaWP/?p=738">Kayuba.org</a>
                a local group that dives the ocean reef system off the Fort Lauderdale
                shoreline; members each use a kayak as their own self-contained dive
                platform. The group has also been a volunteer force in community events
                including the annual Bonnett House cleanup,
                Broward County IntraCoastal cleanup, the <a

    <span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:'Times New Roman'; color:black">
        <p> I built my first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81" target="_blank">Sinclair 1K computer</a> from
            a kit in the early 80s; I'm pretty certain my dad,
            seeing me with the soldering iron and piles of transistors was convinced I had
            thrown away $100 of hard earned paper route nickels. I soon moved on to one of
            the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe" target="_blank">Apple //e</a> machines off the
            production line in
            83 and continuing to
            befuddle my parents <a href="http://www.merware.net/marc/MeSSoftwarePIIMod.jpg">formed
                MES Software in NY</a>, and wrote DesktopPlanner long
            before Microsoft knew what Schedule+ was (and long before I knew what patents
            were).</p>
    </span>


    <p>I was employed at
        Microsoft for 22 years, summer '92 through summer '14.&nbsp; Novel ideas, and
        their detailed development led to a wonderful couple decades <a
            href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;Query=IN%2FSeinfeld-Marc-E+OR+Seinfeld-Marc">yielding
            ample patent filings</a>, along with several full product cycles. Across 3
        major areas: email, mobile and antimalware, from V0 conception --> V3++ versions, alongside a team of incredible
        engineers, we shipped commercial software to 100s of millions of customers.</p>

    <p>Many of my projects have
        been influenced by an idea i had early in life
        of being able to work from anywhere in the world, in an e-connected yet
        untethered manner... eg. from
        the beach, or the deck of a boat. What a fantastic ride!</p>


    <ul type="circle">
        <li>I had direct involvement in the design and
            shipping of Microsoft Exchange Server (v4.0 aka 1.0, v5.0, v5.5 and successive
            versions) in a Program Management capacity. Having sold 100 million email
            'seats', Exchange is the third most commercially successful software package in
            history (with only MS Windows and MS Word having sold more seats).</li>
        <br>

        <li>In a Group Program Management capacity i designed and delivered 2 versions of Mobile Information
            Server, a server setup to wirelessly extend the reach of Exchange email, calendar
            and contacts to phones and other wireless mobile devices. As part of this team i am named as an inventor on
            7 of the 14 patents filed by
            the team; 6 of these have been issued by the USPTO, and one is still patent
            pending. The gem in the rough here was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_ActiveSync"
                target="_blank">ActiveSync protocol</a> developed for
            efficient OTA (over the air) synchronization across latent mobile networks; this
            was later monetized via licensing with Apple and numerous top-tier Android
            vendors.</li>
        <br>

        <li>In a Group Program Manager capacity I further led
            the Windows team into new territory in the AntiMalware space; as an individual
            contributor I continued working remotely for the Windows team from Hong Kong
            and currently from various locations around the US. In my time with this team
            have been named as an inventor on numerous patent filings. Our work has
            directly resulted in producing the Windows Malicious Software Removal tool (aka

<p>While on a sabatical from MS in mid-2002, with longtime software
    engineering colleague &amp; friend <a

        Bell</a>, I built <a href="http://132.148.76.218:81/ofr/about/">DiveShop.net</a>--
    a comprehensive and custom tailored reservation booking and resource management
    system for <a href="http://www.OceanFrontiers.com">Ocean Frontiers</a> dive
    shop in Grand Cayman built on Microsoft's .NET framework, IIS and SQL
    server. The diveshop owner who we collaborated
    with on this project, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenbroadbelt">Steve
        Broadbelt</a>, who I have dove with since '96, could
    also vouch for my comfort in the water and interest in dive related
    physiology and research, as well as my passion for aquatic creatures
    and their preservation... as well as the stability, and feature rich capability
    of the system and the degree to which he's since bet his business from a front
    and back office perspective on its capabilities.</p>
